# Snake

Program Summary: 

Simple immplementation of the game "Snake" written in Java. 

Controls and Rules:

Use the arrow keys to move. Collect the red squares to grow longer. The game ends
if you intersect yourself or you go out of bounds     

To Compile and Run:

If you are not using an IDE you can compile the program from the terminal by 
using the commands: 

  javac Game.java
 
  javac Snake.java

Once these commands are run you should see the class functions Game.class and 
Snake.class show up in your working directory (side note: ensure all the files
are in the same folder/directory)

Once this is done you can now run the program from the terminal using the 
command:

  java Snake

Also, it should go without saying you will need to have some version of Java  
installed in order for any of this to work.  

If all goes well you will be able to play my version of Snake. 

Have Fun!!
